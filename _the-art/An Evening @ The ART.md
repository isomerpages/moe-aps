An Evening @ The ART
====================

Every Evening at The ART features a different theme and cuisine, not only to tantalise the taste buds of the guests, but also to expand the current training scope for the students to serve in different settings.

  

In addition, they also impart invaluable skills and expertise to the students in food preparations as well as engaging them in unique cooking techniques to develop their culinary skills to higher levels.

For the students, this gives them real-life training as to how to serve customers in a larger setting as well to build up their interpersonal skills as well.    

As part of the learning experience, guest chefs also conduct training workshops before the event for the students' hands-on learning.
