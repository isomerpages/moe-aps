<h3>Importance of Partnership to APS</h3>
<p>Assumption Pathway School (APS) aims to&nbsp;reinforce student learning
in the 3 pillars of education:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foundation Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vocational Education</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This could only be made possible with the support and contribution that
are given to APS by the partners. The partners&nbsp;create platforms for
APS students to be connected and succeed in the real world. They also provide
learning opportunities for the students as well.</p>
<p>APS&nbsp;is grateful for the support and resources that the partners have
given. As a community, the school works together to develop programmes
and initiatives in the best interests of the students. The support and
contribution of the partners are pivotal in helping the school gain valuable
insight and knowledge to improve and to do even better.</p>
