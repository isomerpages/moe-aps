### Importance of Partnership to APS

Assumption Pathway School (APS) aims to reinforce student learning in the 3 pillars of education:  
  

*   Foundation Education
*   Character Education
*   Vocational Education

  

This could only be made possible with the support and contribution that are given to APS by the partners. The partners create platforms for APS students to be connected and succeed in the real world. They also provide learning opportunities for the students as well.  

APS is grateful for the support and resources that the partners have given. As a community, the school works together to develop programmes and initiatives in the best interests of the students. The support and contribution of the partners are pivotal in helping the school gain valuable insight and knowledge to improve and to do even better.
