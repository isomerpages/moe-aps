Alumni
======

APS Alumni was founded in 2017 with graduates of APS and its predecessors from Assumption Vocational Institute and Boys’ Town Vocational Institute. The President of the Alumni is Dr Roland Yeow Theng Nam, Executive Director of Boys’ Town Singapore.&nbsp;

School Management Committee (SMC) Chairman Mr Gabriel Teo also hopes to form a support network with the alumni members. The alumni aims to extend its outreach to more members. This is to encourage and foster close and strong relationships as well as to build a sustainable and inclusive community.

Some of the alumni activities include the BBQ Bonding Day where alumni members get together to enjoy some good food and to relive the good old friendships and times. The alumni is also involved in the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel Sports Fiesta, where they form a team to compete in the games. This is all in the good spirit of team bonding.

The APS Alumni team actively participated in the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel Sports Fiesta in 2017 and 2018.
