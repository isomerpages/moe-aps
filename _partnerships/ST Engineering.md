<h4>The ACT at ST Engineering</h4>
<p>The ACT (Assumption Café for Training) is located at ST Engineering’s
office building in Jurong East. ST Engineering has helped set up this training
café with APS to create authentic learning opportunities and enable APS
students to earn real work experiences beyond the familiarity of the school
compound. As the first on-the-job training platform at an external non-school
based premise serving ST Engineering staff, guests and visitors, The ACT
provides a higher tier training for students to be work ready.</p>
