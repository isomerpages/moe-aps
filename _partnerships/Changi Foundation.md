the philanthropy arm of Changi Airport Group (CAG) supporting and commit
to youth development.</p>
<p>As part of Changi Foundation's focus on Transition-to-Work programmes
to increase youthsâ€™ employability, the grants have been instrumental in
supporting our Assumption Pathway Academy through funding traineeship allowances
for the Academy students.</p>
<p>With this on-going support since 2018, the Academy students are able to
learn and earn at APS on-the-job training platforms, to better prepare
transiting to real work.</p>
