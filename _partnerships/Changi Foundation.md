Changi Airport Group (CAG) is an organisation that revolves around airport operations to ensure that flights run smoothly and that the passengers have a smooth and comfortable transit experience. CAG also believes in reaching out to the community to help the disadvantaged youths to realise their dreams.

CAG launched the **Changi Foundation** in April 2012 to support and commit to youth development.

Changi Foundation has been funding for the education and bursary awards given to APS students over the years.  

In addition, Changi Foundation is also supporting APS for the Assumption Pathway Academy (APA) Traineeship Allowances since 2018. With this continuous support, APA students are able to earn an allowance and continue learning at the same time during their 2-year Work-Study Programme.
