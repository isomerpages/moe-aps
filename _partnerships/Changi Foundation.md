the philanthropy arm of Changi Airport Group (CAG) supporting and commit
to youth development.</p>
<p>As part of Changi Foundation's focus on Transition-to-Work programmes
to increase youthsâ€™ employability, the grants have been instrumental in
supporting our <a href="https://www.aps.edu.sg/assumption-pathway-academy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Assumption Pathway Academy</a> through
funding the traineeship allowances.</p>
<p>With this on-going support since 2018, the Academy students are able to
Learn and Earn at <a href="https://www.aps.edu.sg/aps-ojt-platforms/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">APS on-the-job training platforms</a>,
and to better prepare transiting to real work.</p>
