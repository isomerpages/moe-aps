Temasek Foundation

Since 2011, Temasek Foundation supported APS in engaging specialised staff to enhance the capabilities and competencies of students with learning and socio-emotional needs. These specialised staff assist the school in building its assessment, screening and intervention processes, to help students overcome the various obstacles that impede their ability to learn. Emphasis is also placed on behavioural and character competencies that prepare these students for life beyond the classroom.

Temasek Foundation supported APS for its numeracy programme from 2015 to 2016 with the objective of improving the numeracy competency of the students.  
   
In 2017, with the support of Temasek Foundation, APS looked into the provision of occupational therapy services to students with psychomotor skills or sensory integration challenges. Students with such issues will find it difficult to learn the necessary skills required under their vocational course. Addressing these issues through occupational therapy sessions will therefore enhance the learning and assimilation of vocational skills for such students.

  
Temasek Foundation has also contributed to other school programmes, such as bursaries, a jamming studio and a canteen stall for sale of baking products by APS students. Through APS’ collaborative efforts with Temasek Foundation, the school aims to nurture the students and to develop their skills and potential to the fullest.

Occupational Therapy Programme
------------------------------

With the support from Temasek Foundation (TF), APS is able to embark on the Occupational Therapy (OT) Programme to help students with sensory integration issues which impact their ability to learn optimally. Through the support and dedication from the Occupational Therapist, the students are better able to acquire the required skills and are more confident of themselves. APS is grateful for the support from TF, which has been beneficial in helping students with special educational needs.
