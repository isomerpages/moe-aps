Montfortian Education Charter
============================

The Montfortian Education Charter is based on the ideals and beliefs of our patron Saint Louis Marie De Montfort. It upholds the tenets to guide the school to plan its programmes to be responsive to the demands of the 21st Century and nurture each student to be contributing members of society.
