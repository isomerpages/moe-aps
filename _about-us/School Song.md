<p><strong>ASSUMPTION PATHWAY SCHOOL</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>School Song Lyrics</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once more unite our youthful voices</p>
<p>Amidst our halls the strain to raise</p>
<p>With rapid swell the heart rejoices</p>
<p>When virtue is the theme of praise</p>
<p>We follow those who have trodden up-rightly</p>
<p>As well in sunshine as in rain</p>
<p>Students old and new we do fashion so tightly</p>
<p>Enduring links of one long chain</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>
</p>
<p>We, students of Assumption Pathway School,</p>
<p>When God from on high sheds his light on our way,</p>
<p>We, students of Assumption Pathway School,</p>
<p>The White and the Blue shall be known far and wide,</p>
<p>The White and the Blue, the White and the Blue,</p>
<p>Shall be ever Boys' Town's pride.</p>
