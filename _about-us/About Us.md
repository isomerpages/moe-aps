<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Assumption Pathway School (APS) is a Catholic educational institution
transforming and empowering students who are unable to access or complete
secondary education to help them achieve personal success.</p>
<p>APS, as a specialised school, offers vocational programmes accredited
by ITE as well as foundation and character development programmes developed
in collaboration with MOE.</p>
<p>APS was founded on 17 Jan 1938 as St Joseph’s Trade School and was started
by two religious brothers from the Catholic Order of the Brothers of St
Gabriel. In 1970, St Joseph’s Trade School was renamed Boys’ Town Trade
School. A year later, it was renamed Boys’ Town Vocational Institute. On
1 Apr 1994, the Institute took the name of Assumption Vocational Institute
(AVI) to facilitate the intake of girls in Jan 1995. In tandem with changes
in the educational landscape, AVI became APS in 2009 with an expanded curriculum,
particularly in foundation subjects and character education.</p>
<p>Currently, APS is managed by the St Gabriel’s Foundation under the Montfort
Brothers of St Gabriel, an order of the Catholic Teaching Brothers founded
by St Louis Marie de Montfort.</p>
