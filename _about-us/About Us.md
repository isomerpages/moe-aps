About Us
========

Assumption Pathway School (APS) is a Catholic educational institution transforming and empowering students who are unable to access or complete secondary education to help them achieve personal success.

APS, as a specialised school, offers vocational programmes accredited by ITE as well as foundation and character development programmes developed in collaboration with MOE.

APS was founded on 17 Jan 1938 as St Joseph’s Trade School and was started by two religious brothers from the Catholic Order of the Brothers of St Gabriel. In 1970, St Joseph’s Trade School was renamed Boys’ Town Trade School. A year later, it was renamed Boys’ Town Vocational Institute. On 1 Apr 1994, the Institute took the name of Assumption Vocational Institute (AVI) to facilitate the intake of girls in Jan 1995. In tandem with changes in the educational landscape, AVI became APS in 2009 with an expanded curriculum, particularly in foundation subjects and character education.

Currently, APS is managed by the St Gabriel’s Foundation under the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel, an order of the Catholic Teaching Brothers founded by St Louis Marie de Montfort.
