<p>During final year at the Academy, students will be deployed to workplaces
with our partners under the<strong> Industry Support Programme (ISP)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the programme, our Job Coaches work closely with the partners
to oversee studentsâ€™ progression and continue guiding students to apply
their learning in the real world context. With the ongoing support, it
eases the students' transition into employment.</p>
