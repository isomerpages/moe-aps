<p><strong>Assumption Pathway Academy</strong> was set up in 2015 to provide
an additional pathway for APS graduates who are unable to qualify for the
Institute of Technical Education (ITE) or do not feel ready to join the
workforce.</p>
<p>Selected APS graduates will be guided to enroll in the Academy where they
undergo the <strong>Learn and Earn Programme </strong>that further prepare
them to be work ready.</p>
<p>The Academy students will be engaged in On-the-Job Training (<strong>OJT</strong>)
supported by Job Coaches; as well as undertake essential Workforce Skills
Qualifications (<strong>WSQ</strong>) courses and modules to deepen their
work skills.</p>
